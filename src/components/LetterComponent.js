                <p>Blessings in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

                <p>Welcome to Shepherd’s Pasture Assembly where our doors and our hearts are open to everyone seeking to find a safe haven for spiritual life and growth.</p>

                <p>What our guests usually notice firsthand with Shepherd’s Pasture Assembly is the tender presence of God in our worship gatherings, the warm fellowship, the in-debt teachings, and the flow of the Holy Spirit.</p>

                <p>At SPA, you are surrounded by a community of people just like you – people filled with hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, strengths and weaknesses, but with a common thread being, that they are committed to growing stronger through it all and with one another through Christ.</p>

                <p>At SPA we have something for all ages! We offer a great Sunday School for the children, a Discipleship Program (Life Group) for the adults, and a Young People Ministry for the youths and young adults. We also have the 1st Friday (of the month) Worship and Healing Night, a time of worship and prayer for God to touch felt needs.</p>

                <p>So whether you are a spiritual seeker desiring to know God, or in need of God's healing, or that you are looking for a church you desire to be a part of, we warmly welcome you here at Shepherd’s Pasture Assembly.</p>

                <p>God Bless You,</p>

                <p>Pastor Noel</p>
